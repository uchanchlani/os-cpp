# Utkarsh Chanchlani | Operating Systems Fall 2018 course 611 repository
Main branch is **master**. I'll make sure the main branch ie the **master** is never corrupted. For the sake of submissions, you should always **consider the files in master branch as my final submission.**
There has been a sweet mistake, where my virtualbox is committing files with the user name ta-virtuabox-guest (or something similar). Please make a note of it. All the commits which are made by user name utkarshc are my commits which I've commited via my machine and all the commits that are with the said user id are also my commits but from within the virtualbox.

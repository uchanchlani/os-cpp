# Utkarsh Chanchlani | Operating Systems Fall 2018 course 611 repository
Main branch is **master**. I'll make sure the main branch ie the **master** is never corrupted. For the sake of submissions, you should always **consider the files in master branch as my final submission.**
## MP1 
The code changes for the assignment are there in the master branch. For the gdb related project level changes, I've created a separate branch mp1/gdb

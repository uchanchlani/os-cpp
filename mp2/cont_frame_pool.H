 Description: Management of the CONTIGUOUS Free-Frame Pool.
 
 As opposed to a non-contiguous free-frame pool, here we can allocate
 a sequence of CONTIGUOUS frames.

     * stored in exactly x no of bits but I don't like the design somehow

     The number returned here depends on the implementation of the frame pool and 
     on the frame size.
     EXAMPLE: For FRAME_SIZE = 4096 and a bitmap with a single bit per frame 
     (not appropriate for contiguous allocation) one would need one frame to manage a 
     frame pool with up to 8 * 4096 = 32k frames = 128MB of memory!
     This function would therefore return the following value:
       _n_frames / 32k + (_n_frames % 32k > 0 ? 1 : 0) (always round up!)
     Other implementations need a different number of info frames.
     The exact number is computed in this function..
